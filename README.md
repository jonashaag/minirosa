minirosa
========

This is a fork of [librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) that removes
most of the dependencies and with it the "import everything by default" behaviour.
It is intended to be used when you only need a subset of librosa features and
cannot (or do not want to) install all of the dependencies.
